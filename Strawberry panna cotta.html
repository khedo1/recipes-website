<hr>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>3 gelatine leaves</li>
<li>450ml double cream</li>
<li>200ml whole milk </li>

<li>100g white caster sugar</li>
<li>1 vanilla pod</li>

</ul>

    <li>Step 1</li>


<ul>
    <div>
    <li>For the panna cotta, put the gelatine leaves in a small bowl of cold water to soften – this will take about 5 mins. Meanwhile, pour the cream, milk and sugar into a pan, split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds and add, along with the pod, to the cream mixture. </li>
<li>Heat gently until hot, but not bubbling. Remove the gelatine leaves from the water, squeeze out any excess liquid then add, one at a time, to the hot cream.</li>
<li>Stir until dissolved. Leave to stand for 20-30 mins until cooled – the vanilla pods should be suspended in the liquid by this point.</li>
<li>Strain the mixture through a sieve into 6 serving glasses, then chill for at least 3 hrs.</li>

</div>
</ul>




    <li>Step 2 </li>

<ul><div>
<li>Toss the strawberries with the cornflour and sugar in a saucepan. </li>
<li>Place over a medium heat and cook for 4-5 mins, until the released juices thicken and the strawberries soften. </li>
<li>Set aside to cool. Once completely cooled, top the set panna cottas with the strawberry mixture. Chill until ready to serve.</li>

</ol>

</div></ul>
